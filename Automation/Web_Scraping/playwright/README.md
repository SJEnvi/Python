Hi,

This project is basically an assignment I got during one recruitment process.
You can find the task description below:

Implement a program that automatically scrapes all quotes (from all next pages) from the
http://quotes.toscrape.com/js-delayed/ website and saves them to a singlejsonl (JSON Lines) file upon execution.
Note: The program should scrape the website http://quotes.toscrape.com/js-delayed/ where the text appears with a
random delay of a few seconds.

I used playwright and BeautifulSoup in my code and I have to say that it was a lot of fun to learn those libraries under the pressure of time.
